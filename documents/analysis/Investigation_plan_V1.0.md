# Investigation plan

# Expectations

### What is being done?

- Definition of stakeholders
- Investigar sistemas similares
- Delimitation of the problem
- Usr
- Objectives definition
- Creation of data collection artifacts
- Discovery of our users’ environment

### How is it being done?

- Our plan focuses on the definition of objectives to guide us through the collection of information, as a tool for this purpose we use Notion which also serves as a document repository where we can find the information collection artifacts for this stage.
- As part of our education process we are considering different techniques in addition to the interview such as snowballing and analysis of similar applications.
- Defining interview artifact objectives
- Using education methods to identify who our stakeholders are

### ¿What results are expected?

- From the defined plan we expect to know enough about the problem so that we can offer a software solution.
- Considering that we are using a qualitative technique, we expect to receive more complex answers from our stakeholders that involve

# Stakeholders

- Students
    - These are the primary stakeholders who will be receiving the tutoring services. They may include students who are struggling in specific subjects, those with learning disabilities, or those who are looking to improve their academic performance.
- Tutor students
    - These are the individuals who will provide the tutoring services. They may be current students or professionals in the field of education.
- School
    - Schools and colleges may be interested in this project, as it could help their students who are struggling academically.
    - The school is one of our key stakeholders, as it serves as a center for academic learning and champions the recognition of students' efforts. By providing a software application that acknowledges the work of students, the school demonstrates a commitment to fostering camaraderie, enhancing mastery of knowledge, and improving service delivery. Such practices not only support academic achievement but also cultivate valuable skills that extend beyond the classroom

# Users

1. **Students seeking tutoring:** These students may be struggling with a particular subject or course, looking for additional guidance and support outside of the classroom, or trying to improve their grades. They may be undergraduate or graduate students, and they could come from a variety of academic programs.
2. **Students offering tutoring:** These students are willing to offer their expertise to help other students. They may be interested in tutoring for a particular subject or course, or they may have a more general interest in helping others succeed academically. They may be undergraduate or graduate students, and they could come from a variety of academic programs.
3. **University administrators:** While not direct users of the tutoring service, university administrators could also be considered users in the sense that they will be responsible for overseeing and supporting the program. They may be interested in the program's effectiveness, student engagement, and overall impact on the university community.

# Goals

1. Analyze the forms and ways in which interaction between students occurs when they are in a process of interaction such as receiving/providing academic support.
    1. To account for how often they receive help from their peers and the length of time such encounters are prolonged.
    2. Define what are the means for interaction and the reasons for it.
    3. To note the possible causes and reasons why students seek peer support.
2. To find out which materials are the most used by the students of the mathematics faculty.

## Why is the research being conducted?

The research is being conducted with the objective of gathering information about the problems caused by the lack of understanding of academic subjects that lead students down two consequent paths: to seek alternative materials to those offered by their teachers or to seek help from peers.

## How will the results be implemented?

The results will lead to the execution of our requirements elicitation plan where, after analyzing the research results, we will seek to propose an innovative software solution exploring new fields of human computer interaction.

The analysis of these results will be done by implementing a series of steps to categorize the results obtained from a specific methodology.

“The interviewer should mentally immerse himself/herself in the primary material collected (transcribing interviews, recordings and descriptions), to make an overview that ensures a good categorization process and thus make meaningful classifications" (*Díaz-Bravo, et al; 2013)*

After the categorization we will seek to find possible points of improvement in the student-student interaction with the purpose of obtaining a software solution that can be used by the students and improve their interaction process.

# Agenda

Our analysis process is intended to be completed in two weeks, having started with the completion of our data collection artifact through which we will conduct at least a number of 25 interviews.
