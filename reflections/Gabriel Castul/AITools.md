> AI tools are on fashion. Developers are exploring the potential of tools such as chat GPT to generate automatically apps. There are many examples of code produce by AI tools. Research and select one tool, explore and try some examples to produce UI that includes specific features related with usability attributes. Based on your research and experience explain the real potential of the AI tools and the constrains. Provide some arguments related the following points:

> -   What's the quality of the UI you could produce?
> -   How was your experience producing UI with an AI tool? Is it easy to use the AI tool?
> -   Considering the final result of the UI, to how extend it include the usability attribute?
> -   Will the UX role change significantly with the development of AI tools? How?

### For this reflection I used the aforementioned ChatGPT to ask it to make me a registration and login page and I came to the following conclusions:

  

The quality of a web page produced by an AI will depend largely on the type of AI used and the quality of the input data provided to it. However, in terms of quality, web pages produced by an AI may not be comparable to those produced by an experienced human web designer.

  

Web pages created by an AI may lack custom design elements and may not have the same sensitivity to detail that a human designer can provide. In addition, AI may lack the creativity needed to create innovative or cutting-edge designs.

  

Using the AI was relatively easy since I only had to give it a context of what I required, giving specific information about the fields I needed, taking into account that when I pressed the "Enter" button it generated an HTML code in a matter of seconds, it is really impressive how easy it is to interact with the AI. In usability attributes it could be said that it does a regular job because it generates a too simple code which has a good usability but without reaching higher terms.

  

As for the role of user experience I believe it will change significantly in conjunction with artificial intelligence tools since there are functions such as "Design-to-Code" belonging to Figma where this tool uses machine learning algorithms to generate code automatically from a design file in Figma, which makes it easier and faster for developers to create functional user interfaces. Therefore a developer by simply making a good design that can provide a good user experience could generate the code immediately and thus boost their productivity with the use of AIs making a significant change in the ease of creating a good user experience.
