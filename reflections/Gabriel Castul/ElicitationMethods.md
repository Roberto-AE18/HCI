>Elicitation methods are essential techniques/tools for User Research. Based on your team project provide a contrast of an elicitation technique used by the team based on an artifact on the project's repo. The goal of this reflection is to provide clear information regarding how close (or far) the team followed. Provide a constructive criticism how the technique and resulting artifact could be improved. Provide following points:

> -   Considerations of the original technique.
    
> -   How the technique was implemented.
    
> -   Outcome of the technique (based on artifacts). What could be improved?
    

  

### Based on the project repository, the team used surveys as a technique for obtaining feedback from users on their experience with the tutorials.

  

- The team partially followed the considerations of the original technique. Surveys are typically used to collect data on a large scale, and the team used a survey to gather feedback from a group of users. However, the survey questions were not as structured or standardized as they could have been, making it difficult to compare responses and draw meaningful conclusions.

  

- The technique was applied by creating a survey using Google Forms and distributing it to a group of users from different semesters of the Software Engineering program. The survey included a mix of closed and open questions that allowed users to give their opinion on various aspects of student tutoring to other students (Duration, Effectiveness, Skills improvement).

  

- The outcome of the technique, based on artifacts, was mixed. The survey provided useful information about the experience of students who have tutored as well as those who have been tutored, such as identifying areas where users had difficulties or where they believed tutoring could be improved. However, the open-ended questions did not always provide clear and practical information, and the lack of standardization of the closed-ended questions made it difficult to compare responses and draw meaningful conclusions.

  

- In terms of constructive criticism, the team might consider using a more structured approach to survey design in the future. This could involve the use of standardized questions or scales to collect quantitative data, as well as ensuring that open-ended questions are designed to elicit clear and specific responses. In addition, the team could consider using other elicitation techniques in combination with surveys, such as think-aloud protocols or interviews, to collect more qualitative data and provide additional context to the quantitative data collected through surveys. This could help to obtain a more complete picture of students' experience with tutoring and lead to more effective improvements.
