>Personas has become a relevant method to design products. Regular methods and techniques for designing products are based on functional features and demographic data of users. However, Personas is focused on provide a deeper understanding of the user based on usersâ€™ needs, experiences, behaviors and goals. Consider your team's project and based on the Personas Toolkit and Lene Nielsen template (both provided on resources section) choose one category (needs, experiences, behaviors and goals) and explain the following:

> -   What are specifics items of the toolkit selected for collecting? Why are relevant for your project?
> -   What was the method to collect the items? What's the method to analise and syntetise the data for an specific item?
> -   Explain a specific example of the use of how it will be the influence or the impact Personas on the product.

### For the team's project, the category of "needs" is particularly relevant for developing personas. The specific items of the Personas Toolkit selected for collecting include:

- **Tasks:** This involves understanding the tasks or activities that users need to perform while using the platform, such as searching for tutors or scheduling tutoring sessions. This information is important for designing a user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation.

- **Pain points:** This involves identifying the pain points or frustrations that users may experience while finding a suitable tutor or technical issues. This information is important for addressing these issues and improving the user experience.

- **Motivations:** This involves understanding the motivations or reasons why users would use the platform, such as improving their grades, gaining new skills or the most important : have a recognition in the form of scholar credits. This information is important for designing features that align with users' goals and values.

To collect this information, the team used a variety of methods such as interviews, surveys, or observation. For example, the team conducted interviews with current or potential users of the platform to understand their needs, pain points, and motivations. We also used surveys to gather quantitative data on these topics. To analyze and synthesize the data.

After collecting and analyzing data on user needs, the team created personas that represent different types of users who would use the platform. These personas include information on their goals, motivations, pain points, and tasks. Using these personas, the team design features and functionalities that meet the needs and preferences of different user types. For instance, a persona representing a busy student might prioritize features such as scheduling flexibility and ease of use, while a persona representing a new or more novice student might prioritize features such as access to specialized tutors or the ability to track progress over time.

  
Overall, personas can have a significant impact on the design and development of the app by providing a deeper understanding of users' needs, behaviors, and goals. By using personas, the team can create a user-centric design that aligns with users' values and preferences, leading to a better user experience and increased adoption of the app.
